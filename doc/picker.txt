CONFIGURATION                                             *picker-configuration*

By default nvim-picker will use `pick` (https://github.com/thoughtbot/pick) as
the fuzzy selector. You can change this by setting `g:picker_selector` in your
`init.vim` file. For example, to use `selecta`
(https://github.com/garybernhardt/selecta) set:
>
    let g:picker_selector = 'selecta'
