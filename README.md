# vim-picker [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/srstevenson/vim-picker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/srstevenson/vim-picker)

[vim-picker] is a fuzzy picker for [Neovim] and [Vim].

</p>

vim-picker allows you to search for and select files, buffers, and tags using a
fuzzy selector such as [`fzy`][fzy], [`pick`][pick], or [`selecta`][selecta].
It has advantages over plugins with a similar purpose such as [ctrlp.vim] and
[Command-T]:

* It uses the [embedded terminal emulator][nvim-terminal] when used within
  Neovim, so the fuzzy selector does not block the UI. Whilst selecting an item
  you can move to another buffer, edit that buffer, and return to the fuzzy
  selector to continue where you left off.
* It adheres to the Unix philosophy, and does not reimplement existing tools.
  File listing is achieved using the best tool for the job: `git` in Git
  repositories and [`rg`][rg] elsewhere, falling back to `find` if `rg` is not
  available. Fuzzy text selection is done with `fzy` by default: a fast, well
  behaved interactive filter.
* It doesn't define default key mappings, allowing you to define your own
  mappings that best fit your workflow and don't conflict with your other
  plugins.

## Installation

To use vim-picker you will first need a fuzzy selector such as [`fzy`][fzy],
[`pick`][pick], or [`selecta`][selecta] installed. See their respective
homepages for installation instructions.

To install vim-picker using [vim-plug], add the following to your vimrc
(`$HOME/.vim/vimrc` for Vim and
`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/nvim/init.vim` for Neovim), restart Vim, and
run `:PlugInstall`:

```viml
Plug 'srstevenson/vim-picker'
```

Using [Dein.vim], add the following to your vimrc, restart Vim, and run `:call
dein#install()`:

```viml
call dein#add('srstevenson/vim-picker')
```

Using [Vundle], add the following to your vimrc, restart Vim, and run
`:PluginInstall`:

```viml
Plugin 'srstevenson/vim-picker'
```

## Commands

vim-picker provides the following commands:

* `:PickerEdit`: Pick a file with fuzzy selection to edit in the current
  window.
* `:PickerSplit`: Pick a file with fuzzy selection to edit in a new horizontal
  split.
* `:PickerTabedit`: Pick a file with fuzzy selection to edit in a new tab.
* `:PickerVsplit`: Pick a file with fuzzy selection to edit in a new vertical
  split.
* `:PickerBuffer`: Pick a buffer with fuzzy selection to edit in the current
  window.
* `:PickerTag`: Pick a tag to jump to with fuzzy selection.

## Key mappings

vim-picker defines the following [`<Plug>`][plug-mappings] mappings:

* `<Plug>PickerEdit`: Execute `:PickerEdit`.
* `<Plug>PickerSplit`: Execute `:PickerSplit`.
* `<Plug>PickerTabedit`: Execute `:PickerTabedit`.
* `<Plug>PickerVsplit`: Execute `:PickerVsplit`.
* `<Plug>PickerBuffer`: Execute `:PickerBuffer`.
* `<Plug>PickerTag`: Execute `:PickerTag`.

These are not mapped to key sequences, to allow you to choose those that best
fit your workflow and don't conflict with other plugins you use. However if you
have no preference, the following snippet maps each mapping to a mnemonic key
sequence:

```viml
nmap <unique> <leader>pe <Plug>PickerEdit
nmap <unique> <leader>ps <Plug>PickerSplit
nmap <unique> <leader>pt <Plug>PickerTabedit
nmap <unique> <leader>pv <Plug>PickerVsplit
nmap <unique> <leader>pb <Plug>PickerBuffer
nmap <unique> <leader>p] <Plug>PickerTag
```

## Configuration

`fzy` is used as the default fuzzy selector. To use an alternative selector,
set `g:picker_selector` in your vimrc. For example, set

```viml
let g:picker_selector = 'pick'
```

to use `pick`. vim-picker has been tested with `fzy`, `pick`, and `selecta`,
but any well behaved command line filter should work.
