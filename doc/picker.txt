CONFIGURATION                                             *picker-configuration*

By default vim-picker will use `fzy` (https://github.com/jhawthorn/fzy) as the
fuzzy selector. You can change this by setting `g:picker_selector` in your
|vimrc|. For example, to use `pick` (https://github.com/calleerlandsson/pick)
set:
>
    let g:picker_selector = 'pick'
